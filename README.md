**Instructions to Use the `README.md` File:**

1. **Copy the Markdown Content:**

   Select all the text within the code block above (including the triple backticks) and copy it.

2. **Create a `README.md` File in Your Repository:**

   - If you're using GitHub Desktop:
     - Open your repository in GitHub Desktop.
     - Use your preferred text editor to create a new file named `README.md` in the root directory of your project.
   - If you're using the command line:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/dbt-project-grafana-dashboard
     touch README.md
     ```

3. **Paste the Copied Content:**

   Open `README.md` with a text editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text) and paste the copied content.

4. **Customize the Placeholder Text:**

   - **Replace `your-username`:** Substitute `your-username` with your actual GitHub username in the clone URLs.
   - **Update Email Address:** Change `[your-email@example.com](mailto:your-email@example.com)` to your actual contact email.
   - **Adjust Repository Name:** Ensure the repository name (`dbt-project-grafana-dashboard`) matches your actual repository name.
   - **Modify Any Other Placeholders:** Update any other placeholder text to accurately reflect your project's specifics.

5. **Save and Commit the `README.md` File:**

   - **Using GitHub Desktop:**
     - After saving the file in your text editor, return to GitHub Desktop.
     - You should see `README.md` listed under **Changes**.
     - Add a commit message, e.g., "Add comprehensive README.md".
     - Click **Commit to main**.
     - Click **Push origin** to upload the commit to GitHub.
   
   - **Using Command Line:**
     ```bash
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Add comprehensive README.md"
     git push origin main
     ```

6. **Verify on GitHub:**

   Navigate to your GitHub repository in your web browser to ensure that the `README.md` is correctly displayed on the repository's main page.

**Final Notes:**

- **Keep the README Updated:** As your project evolves, ensure that the `README.md` reflects any changes or new features.
- **Enhance Documentation:** Consider adding sections like "Troubleshooting," "FAQ," or "Contributing Guidelines" if applicable.
- **Use Badges:** You can add badges (e.g., build status, license) at the top of the README for quick reference.
